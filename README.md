# Politics bot

An app that exists for two important reasons.

1. Scrapin' sites, checking for updated data, and sending Slack alerts about that.
2. Tellin' (and responding to) knock-knock jokes.

Current sites the bot monitors:
 - Minnesota Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Board
    - Recent candidate filings
    - [Recent lobbyist filings]("https://cfb.mn.gov/reports/current-lists/#/recent-lobbyist-registrations/all/")
